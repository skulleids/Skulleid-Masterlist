        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3">About Skulleids</h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>The Skulleid is a demon-born creature, its body a strange translucent substance—slimy, pliant, almost like liquid-filled silicone—that reveals the bones hidden within. Those bones are most often black as jet, though they sometimes gleam in strange hues, or shine like crystal. From beneath their skin, horns push outward, and no two are the same; some sprout like antlers, others curve in jagged spirals. Their eyes burn with an inner glow, allowing them to see clearly in the dark places where they prefer to linger.

They exist in three states of being. Their true form is the one born in Infernius: skeletal outlines beneath glass-like flesh, luminous eyes, and horned silhouettes lurking in the shadows. Their human guise is a mask, one they wear easily in order to move among mortals unnoticed. Hair and eye color remain constant between forms, though otherwise they may alter their appearance as they wish—sometimes even blending fragments of their true selves into their disguise.

Skulleids do not require food, for their stomachs are voids without hunger or fullness. Yet they eat for pleasure, and they can consume anything. Their sense of taste is mutable: they may savor a meal, or turn it off entirely when feeding upon less desirable fare. Sweets are their greatest delight—sugar floods them with a strange rush of joy, an echo of something almost childlike.

Death does not claim them. Immortality is woven into their nature, and so they linger, often living side by side with humans for years, decades, even centuries. Most have little in the way of special powers beyond their dual form, though on occasion a Skulleid is born touched by magic, able to bend the arcane to their will. Their kind are generally cruel and mischievous, finding amusement in chaos, but they are not unchanging. Like humans, they may grow, soften, or turn from malice, though such cases are rare.

Their origin lies in Infernius, a realm of fire and endless monotony. The majority remain there, slipping between Hell and Earth through hidden portals. Yet a small number abandoned the old ways, seeking excitement in the mortal world, finding more joy in bustling cities and fleeting pleasures than in the drear of their homeland. These are the ones who linger in human society, blending so seamlessly that none would guess what lurks beneath their skin.

In stature they are much like humans, though often taller. Some are small and childlike, though such forms are considered unusual. They claim genders when they choose to, or none at all, shifting as fluidly as their forms. In their natural state they are unclothed, but they are a materialistic species, enamored with human fashion and prone to dressing themselves in whatever the age offers. The most ancient among them wear garments wrought from the heart of the earth, a reminder of their infernal origins.

Once, Skulleids were creatures of shadow, content to haunt the edges of mortal cities and the wastelands between. Now they walk among humankind, smiling with borrowed faces, their true selves hidden beneath the surface. They are eternal wanderers, born of Infernius, but bound always to seek out the unfamiliar, the entertaining, the sweet and fleeting joys that mortal life provides.
